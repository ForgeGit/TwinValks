> Is the order of Twins special ability random?

The following document goes in-depth describing how the first special ability cast during the encounter with the "Val'Kyr Twins" is rigged, and not entirely random, in their Classic version of World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King (2023) - Phase 3.

# Introduction

The Val'kyr Twins are the 4th Boss encounter in the raid the Trial of the Crusader (ToC) and every 45s one (1) of four (4) abilities will occur: 

- [Light Vortex (LV)](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=66046/light-vortex#comments)

- [Shield of Lights (SoL)](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=65858/shield-of-lights)

- [Dark Vortex (DV)](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=66058/dark-vortex#comments)

- [Shield of Darkness (SoD)](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=65874/shield-of-darkness)

The four (4) abilities are cycled through before repeating.

On September 6, 2023, Catnip posted an [exploratory analysis](https://discord.com/channels/253212375790911489/954035835249000509/1148965319256309790) on the distribution of these abilities, and found Shield of Darkness (SoD) as the most commonly first seen ability. 

Further exploration of the 500 encounters suggested the order in which the abilities occurred was not arbitrary and heavily favored a specific ability over the others.

Despite the use of a sampling method that should have guaranteed some degree of independence on each sample, the analysis was met with skepticism due to its sample size, lack of stratification, and lack of causal explanation.

Let's fix that.
