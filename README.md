> Is the sequence of special abilities for the Val'Kyr Twins "random"?

The following document describes the unequal probability of "Val'Kyr Twins" special abilities in their Classic version of World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King (2023) - Phase 3.

There is a pattern on their sequence, but we say it is "random" because we can't establish a causal (?) relationship.
 
## Introduction

The Val'kyr Twins are the 4th Boss encounter in the raid the Trial of the Crusader (ToC). During the encounter, every 45 seconds one (1) of four (4) abilities will occur : 

- [Shield of Darkness (SoD)](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=65874/shield-of-darkness)

- [Dark Vortex (DV)](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=66058/dark-vortex#comments)

- [Shield of Lights (SoL)](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=65858/shield-of-lights)

- [Light Vortex (LV)](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=66046/light-vortex#comments)

The four (4) abilities are cycled through before repeating.

## Background

On September 6, 2023, `cat_nip` (Discord User) conducted an [exploratory analysis](https://discord.com/channels/253212375790911489/954035835249000509/1148965319256309790) into the distribution of these abilities. His findings suggested that Shield of Darkness (SoD) was the most frequently observed initial ability cast across a random sample of logs.

Further examination of the 500 encounters sampled indicated that the sequence in which these abilities happened was uniformly distributed. Instead, a distinct bias was observed towards certain abilities.

Despite the use of a sampling method that should have guaranteed some degree of independence on each sample, the analysis was met with skepticism due to its sample size, lack of stratification, and lack of causal explanation.

Let's fix that.
